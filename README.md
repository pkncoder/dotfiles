# Kia's Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles for my linux distro configuration.

## Extra work when using
The noctalia-shell repo needs to be cloned into quickshell/ *it isn't in it currently due to it being really large*

## Credit where Credit is due

> Note: I may forget some places where I have gotten code / assets

### Wallpapers
orangci/walls - Hand picked wallpapers from this pack

### Quickshell
noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell

### Matugen - Templates
InioX/matugen-themes - Most of the matugen themes that I have in the matugen/templates folder are from here

These may or may not be different than the matugen templates that noctalia-shell uses

## Current Standing

Currently I am using Fedora 43 aarch64 with Niri as my WM, and Noctalia-Shell as my quickshell setup.

Plans to move towards Fedora 43 x86 are iminent (Framework 16 w/ Nvidia 5070).

Currently running a VM on Macos Sequoia 15.2 with UTM.
